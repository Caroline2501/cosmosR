## Overview

COSMOS (Causal Oriented Search of Multi-Omic Space) is a method that integrates phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics data sets. COSMOS leverages extensive prior knowledge of signaling pathways, metabolic networks, and gene regulation  with computational methods to estimate activities of transcription factors and kinases as well as network-level causal reasoning. This pipeline can provide mechanistic explanations for experimental observations across multiple omic data sets.

COSMOS uses [CARNIVAL](https://saezlab.github.io/CARNIVAL/)â€™s Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization strategy to find the smallest coherent subnetwork causally connecting as many deregulated TFs, kinases/phosphatases and metabolites as possible. The subnetwork is extracted from a novel integrated PKN (available [here](http://metapkn.omnipathdb.org/)) spanning signaling, transcriptional regulation and metabolism.  Transcription factors activities are inferred from gene expression with [DoRothEA](https://saezlab.github.io/dorothea/), a meta resource of TF/target links. Kinase activities are inferred from phosphoproteomic with a kinase/substrate network of [Omnipath](http://omnipathdb.org/), a meta resource of protein-protein. [CARNIVAL](https://saezlab.github.io/CARNIVAL/) was adapted to find mechanistic hypotheses connecting the TF and kinase activities with metabolites from a signaling/metabolic prior knowledge network combining [Omnipath](http://omnipathdb.org/), [STITCHdb](http://stitch.embl.de/) and [Recon3D](https://www.vmh.life/).
